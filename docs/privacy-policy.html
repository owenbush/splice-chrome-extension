    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 20, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This extension does not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal data.
        All information is stored locally in your browser and never leaves your device.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Splice License Batch Generator ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do NOT collect any personal data.</strong> The Extension operates entirely within your
        browser and does not transmit any information to external servers owned or operated by us.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The Extension stores the following information <strong>locally in your browser only</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>License Information:</strong> Your Full Legal Name and Artist Name (provided by you in settings)</li>
        <li><strong>Processing State:</strong> Sample names you've entered and processing results</li>
        <li><strong>Extension Preferences:</strong> Your configuration choices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All data is stored using Chrome's local storage API and remains on your device.
        <strong>This data is never transmitted to any server</strong> except when you explicitly
        initiate license generation with Splice.com.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Extension interacts with the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Splice.com:</strong> The Extension uses your existing Splice.com login session to
            search for samples and generate licenses. All communication is directly between your browser
            and Splice.com's servers. We do not intercept, store, or have access to any data transmitted
            to Splice.com.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please refer to <a href="https://splice.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splice's Privacy Policy</a>
        for information about how Splice.com handles your data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Permissions Explained</h2>
    <p>The Extension requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Access to splice.com:</strong> Required to interact with the Splice website,
            search for samples, and generate licenses on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage:</strong> Used to save your license information and extension settings
            locally in your browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cookies:</strong> Used to detect whether you're logged in to Splice.com.
            We only read cookies; we never modify or create them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tabs:</strong> Used to manage Splice.com tabs for API operations without
            disrupting your workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Scripting:</strong> Used to inject code into Splice.com pages to enable
            API communication.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored locally using Chrome's built-in storage API, which is sandboxed and
        protected by Chrome's security model. The license information you provide is encoded
        (Base64) before storage for basic security.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not share, sell, or distribute any of your data.</strong> The Extension
        operates entirely locally and has no backend servers. The only data transmission occurs
        when you explicitly request license generation, and that communication is directly between
        your browser and Splice.com.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        All data is stored in your browser indefinitely until you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear it using the "Clear All Data" button in the Extension's settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the Extension</li>
        <li>Clear your browser's extension data through Chrome settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly
        collect information from children. If you believe a child has provided information through
        the Extension, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> View all data stored by the Extension in Chrome's extension settings</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove all Extension data using the "Clear All Data" button</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Export your license information using the "Export" button in settings</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Remove the Extension at any time, which deletes all stored data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
        with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes
        acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

        practices at: <a href="https://github.com/owenbush/splice-chrome-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        usage statistics, crash reports, or any other data about how you use the Extension.
