## Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Results

#### 1. Prepare Your Sample List
- ‚úÖ Copy filenames directly from your Splice downloads folder
- ‚úÖ Include the `.wav` extension
- ‚úÖ Use one sample per line
- ‚úÖ Remove any extra spaces or blank lines

#### 2. Keep Splice Tab Open
- The extension needs an active Splice.com tab to work
- You can minimize the tab, but don't close it
- Keep yourself logged in to Splice

#### 3. Process in Batches
- For many samples, process in groups of 10-20
- This prevents timeouts and makes it easier to track progress
- Results are saved, so you can process more later

#### 4. Download Immediately
- Download licenses right after generation
- Links may expire after a certain time
- Use the "Reset" button only when you're done downloading

#### 5. Verify Library Status First
- Make sure all samples are in your library before processing
- On Splice.com, check for the heart icon or "In Library" status
- This prevents "not in library" errors

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl/Cmd + A**: Select all text in the input area
- **Ctrl/Cmd + V**: Paste sample names
- **Enter**: Submit (when input has focus)

### Performance Tips

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How many samples can I process at once?**
A: There's no hard limit, but we recommend batches of 10-20 samples for best performance. Processing too many at once may cause timeouts.

**Q: Do I need to keep the extension popup open?**
A: Yes, keep it open while processing. Your progress is saved automatically, so you can close and reopen between batches.

**Q: Are my credentials stored by the extension?**
A: No, the extension uses your existing Splice.com login session. It never stores your username or password.

**Q: What information is stored locally?**
A: Only your license information (Full Legal Name, Artist Name) and your input/results state. All data is stored in your browser and never sent anywhere except to Splice.com for license generation.

**Q: Can I use this extension on multiple computers?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to configure your license information on each computer. Use the Export/Import feature to transfer settings.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need a Splice tab open?**
A: The extension needs access to Splice.com's authentication tokens. Having a tab open ensures proper authentication for API requests.

**Q: What permissions does the extension need?**
A: The extension only requests necessary permissions:
- Access to splice.com (to interact with the website)
- Storage (to save your settings)
- Tabs (to manage Splice tabs)
- Downloads (to save licenses)
- Cookies (to detect login status)

**Q: Is my data encrypted?**
A: Your license information is encoded (Base64) before storage, providing basic security. It's stored locally in your browser.

**Q: Will this work with Splice Sounds (app)?**
A: No, this is a web extension for Chrome. It only works with splice.com in your browser.

---

### Licensing Questions

**Q: Can I generate licenses for samples I haven't downloaded?**
A: Yes, as long as the sample is in your Splice library. You don't need to have downloaded it locally.

**Q: What if a sample I need isn't in my library?**
A: You must add it to your library on Splice.com first. The extension will show an error for samples not in your library.

**Q: How long are license download links valid?**
A: Links are generated fresh each time and should be used immediately. Download right after generation.

**Q: Can I regenerate a license if I lost it?**
A: Yes, simply process the sample again. Each generation creates a new license with a new timestamp.
